      "The complaint filed by AB InBev was “not wellreceived by Heineken” which “pulled a single patent out of its quiver” in retaliation, Brinkman told the judge. He spent much of his opening arguments explaining the history of keg dispenser developments and rebutting AB InBev’s arguments that the patent is invalid. Moll presented his opening arguments outside of the public record because it involved AB InBev’s confidential business information. In 2007, Heineken and InBev settled a European patent battle over InBev’s PerfectDraft home systems. Heineken’s case against AB InBev is being heard first with a trial expected to last through April 23, with AB InBev’s complaint heard before a different judge starting May 6.\n",
