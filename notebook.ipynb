      "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia  — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday mocked U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Kremlin interference in the 2016 presidential election, saying \"a mountain gave birth to a mouse.\" However, Mueller uncovered evidence of a Kremlin operation to interfere with the 2016 vote. He charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with breaking into Democratic Party computers and the email accounts of officials with Hillary Clinton's campaign. Another indictment detailed Russia's use of phony social media accounts to spread divisive rhetoric and to undermine the U.S. political system. Putin alleged Trump's political foes now were \"searching for new pretexts\" to undermine him.\n",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia  — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday mocked U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Kremlin interference in the 2016 presidential election, saying \"a mountain gave birth to a mouse.\" In his first comments since Mueller finished his probe, Putin sought to cast the 22month investigation as a failure and disregarded the special counsel's exposure of a Russian operation to put Donald Trump in the White House. \"It was clear for us from the start that it would end like this,\" the Russian leader said as the Trump administration and Congress sparred over making Mueller's stillconfidential investigation report public. Attorney General William Barr wrote in a summary of Mueller's report that the special counsel found no evidence the Trump campaign \"conspired or coordinated\" with the Russian government to influence the election. However, Mueller uncovered evidence of a Kremlin operation to interfere with the 2016 vote.\n",

      "The complaint filed by AB InBev was “not wellreceived by Heineken” which “pulled a single patent out of its quiver” in retaliation, Brinkman told the judge. He spent much of his opening arguments explaining the history of keg dispenser developments and rebutting AB InBev’s arguments that the patent is invalid. Moll presented his opening arguments outside of the public record because it involved AB InBev’s confidential business information. In 2007, Heineken and InBev settled a European patent battle over InBev’s PerfectDraft home systems. Heineken’s case against AB InBev is being heard first with a trial expected to last through April 23, with AB InBev’s complaint heard before a different judge starting May 6.\n",

      "As American consumers seek quality over quantity in their beer, the world’s two biggest brewers are locked in a legal battle over the quest to serve a freshtapped taste in every mug. HEINY ITC AnheuserBusch InBev SA and Heineken NV are fighting over who invented key parts of a new way to deliver draft beer that allows for smaller batches and eliminates the need for traditional steel kegs, which use compressed air and can degrade flavor over time. “The bars used to put in big kegs of Bud Light and Coors Light and they would sell so much of it that freshness was not an issue,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling said.\n"
